# Camera-SDK

Why IOS SDK? Why we should use it?
- In IOS we can have one common module to use it in different applications. If we want to distribute that module to social world and we donâ€™t want to reveal our logic then we need to create framework of our code. In this article we are going to create one simple custom camera implementation as framework. We can use that framework in any application. 
- Using this framework we can add different kind of functionalities like shutter speed, Video recording, slomotion recording, Photo timer, live filters.
